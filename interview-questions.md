# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer:

- JSX is a way to write HTML-like code in JavaScript and is commonly used in React. One syntax difference between HTML and JSX is the use of "className" in JSX instead of "class" when we specify a CSS element 

Researched answer:

- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code, primarily used in React applications to describe the structure and content of components. It lets you combine HTML and JavaScript into a single file, making your code more modular and easier to manage. The main syntax difference between HTML and JSX is the way attributes are defined. In HTML, attributes are defined using the regular HTML syntax, where you have the attribute name followed by an equals sign, then the value in quotes. For example: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">`. In JSX, attributes are defined using a JavaScript-like syntax, where you use curly braces to insert JavaScript expressions. Also, JSX uses className instead of class to define a CSS class for an element, because class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript. For example: `<img src={imageUrl} alt="An image" />`. Additionally, in JSX, you can write HTML-like syntax directly within your JavaScript code, which allows you to create reusable components and keep your code organized.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer:

- Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript that makes it easy to manage dependencies in your projects. When you run the yarn command in your terminal, the yarn.lock file and the node_modules directory may be modified or created.

Researched answer:

- Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript that was created by Facebook in 2016. Its purpose is to provide a faster, more reliable alternative to the widely used npm package manager. Yarn accomplishes this by using a global cache and parallel downloads, resulting in significantly faster installation times. Yarn also generates a lockfile to ensure consistent installation across different machines, addressing one of the most common issues with npm. It is widely used in the JavaScript community, and it's especially popular for React and React Native projects.

    When you run the yarn command in your terminal, several files and directories may be modified or created. The most important of these is the yarn.lock file, which is similar to the package-lock.json file generated by npm. The yarn.lock file records the exact version numbers of all the dependencies that are installed in your project, along with any transitive dependencies. This ensures that the same versions of packages are installed on every machine where the project is run, which helps to avoid compatibility issues. In addition to the yarn.lock file, the node_modules directory may also be modified or created when you run yarn. This directory contains all the packages that are installed in your project, including their dependencies. The node_modules directory can be quite large, especially for projects with many dependencies, so it's typically excluded from version control systems like Git. When you run yarn in your terminal, it will check the yarn.lock file to determine which packages need to be installed or updated, and then it will download and install them in the node_modules directory.

3. What is a React component?

Your answer:

- In React, a component is like a building block that you can use to create different parts of a website or app. You can think of it as a little section of code that defines what the component looks like and how it behaves. By using components, developers can create more complex user interfaces without having to write a lot of repetitive code. Plus, components can be reused throughout the app, which makes it easier to manage and update the code over time.

Researched answer:

- A React component is a modular, self-contained piece of code that represents a part of the user interface. It encapsulates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic required to render a specific UI element or widget. Each component can be used multiple times in different parts of the application, making it a powerful tool for creating complex UIs. For example, a component might be used to render a button, a form, a menu, or any other element that appears on the screen. React components are designed to be reusable and easy to manage. They can be nested inside other components to create more complex UIs, and can communicate with each other through a system of props and events. This modular architecture allows developers to build large-scale applications that are easier to maintain and update over time. Moreover, React components can be shared across different projects, making it easy to reuse code and create consistent user experiences across different applications.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer:

- State is used to manage internal data that can change over time within a component, while props are used to pass down external data from a parent component to a child component.

Researched answer:

- State and props in React are two different ways to manage data that affects the behavior of a component. State represents internal data that can change over time, while props are external data that is passed down from a parent component to its children. To give an example, let's say you're building a to-do list app. The list of items would be stored in the state of the main component, since it's an internal piece of data that can be updated by the user. On the other hand, the title of the app could be passed down to a child component as a prop, since it's a piece of data that doesn't change and is only needed for display purposes. In short, state is used for managing internal data that changes over time, while props are used for passing external data between components. Understanding the difference between the two is essential for building scalable and efficient React applications.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer:

- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents that represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

Researched answer:

- The DOM is essentially a tree-like structure that represents the HTML (or XML) document as a collection of nodes and objects, which can be manipulated using JavaScript. The topmost node in the DOM is the document node, which represents the entire HTML document. From there, each element, attribute, and text node is represented by a corresponding node in the DOM tree. The DOM provides a way for web developers to programmatically interact with and modify the content and structure of a web page. This includes tasks such as adding or removing elements, changing the style or layout of elements, and responding to user events such as clicks or mouse movements. In summary, the DOM is an essential part of web development and provides a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web pages using JavaScript.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer:

-  The main difference between the div and span tags is that the div tag is a block-level element used to create larger sections of content on the page, while the span tag is an inline element used to group together small pieces of content within a larger block of text.

Researched answer:

- In HTML, the div and span tags are both used to group content together, but they're used for different purposes. The div tag is used to create a new section or area on the page, like a container that can hold other elements. It's great for separating content into different parts of the page, and you can style it with CSS to control how it looks. The span tag, on the other hand, is used to group together small bits of content within a larger block of text. It's perfect for applying styles or formatting to specific words or phrases within a paragraph or heading. The span tag doesn't create a new line before or after the element, so it only takes up as much space as it needs.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming:

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of writing code that models real-world objects, like cars, animals, or people. In OOP, you create "objects" that have their own data and functions, and these objects can interact with each other to perform tasks. For example, let's say you're writing a game. You might create a "player" object that has data like the player's name and health, and functions like "attack" and "heal". You might also create a "monster" object that has similar data and functions. These objects can interact with each other, like when the player attacks the monster or the monster attacks the player.

    OOP has some key concepts like inheritance (where you can create new objects by building on existing ones), polymorphism (where different objects can share the same interface), encapsulation (where you hide the internal workings of an object from the outside world), and abstraction (where you simplify complex systems to make them easier to work with).

2. Ruby:

- Ruby is a high-level, dynamic programming language that was created in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto. It's known for its readability and simplicity, and is often used for web development, as well as for scripting, automation, and data analysis. Ruby is an object-oriented language, which means that everything in Ruby is an object. It's also a dynamically typed language, which means that you don't need to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it. Instead, Ruby figures out the data type at runtime based on the value of the variable. Some popular frameworks and tools built in Ruby include Ruby on Rails (a web framework), Sinatra (a lightweight web framework), RSpec (a testing framework), and Pry (a debugging tool).

3. Implicit return:

- Implicit returns are a feature in certain programming languages, including Ruby and JavaScript, that allow you to return a value from a function without using the explicit return keyword. In Ruby, a method will automatically return the value of the last expression evaluated in the method, unless you use the return keyword to explicitly return a value. For example:

    ```ruby
    def add_numbers(a, b)
        a + b
    end
    print add_numbers(5, 16) 
    # Expected return: 21
    ```
    The expression a + b is the last expression evaluated in the method, so it will be automatically returned as the result of the method. This can make your code more concise and easier to read, since you don't need to include the return keyword for simple functions that return a single value. However, it can also make your code harder to understand if you're not used to this syntax, so it's important to use it judiciously and with clear intent.

4. Ruby blocks:

- In Ruby, a block is a piece of code that can be passed to a method as an argument, just like a variable. It is a way of passing functionality to a method without requiring the creation of a full-blown function. Blocks are typically enclosed in curly braces {} or the do/end keyword, and they can be used to define iterations, conditionals, and other kinds of control structures. Blocks are a key part of Ruby's syntax and are used extensively in both the core language and in many popular libraries and frameworks. Here's an example of a Ruby block:
    ```ruby
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].each do |number|
        puts number * 2
    end
    =begin
    Expected return:
    2
    4
    6
    8
    10
    =end
    ```
5. Ruby hashes:

- In Ruby, a hash is a collection of key-value pairs similar to an object in JavaScript. The keys in a hash must be unique, but the values can be anything. You can create a hash in Ruby using curly braces ({}) and separating the keys and values with a colon (:), like this: my_hash = {key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3}. You can also use the older syntax that uses the hash rocket operator (=>) to separate the keys and values: my_hash = {:key1 => value1, :key2 => value2, :key3 => value3}. Here's a couple of examples:
    ```ruby
    my_hash = { "name" => "Elmer", "age" => 41, "city" => "San Juan" }

    print my_hash
    # Expected output: {"name"=>"Elmer", "age"=>41, "city"=>"San Juan"}
    
    person = {
        name: "Elmer",
        age: 41,
        occupation: "Software Engineer"
    }
    # Expected output: {:name=>"Elmer", :age=>41, :occupation=>"Software Engineer"}
    ```
    Once you have created a hash, you can access its values using the keys, like this: my_hash[:key1]. You can also add new key-value pairs to a hash using the same syntax: my_hash[:key4] = value4. Here's what it would look like:
     ```ruby
    my_hash[":occupation"] = "Software Developer"
    puts my_hash
    # Expected output: {"name"=>"Elmer", "age"=>41, "city"=>"San Juan", ":occupation"=>"Software Developer"}

    person[:city] = "San Juan"
    puts person
    # Expected output: {:name=>"Elmer", :age=>41, :occupation=>"Software Engineer", :city=>"San Juan"}
    ```

    Hashes are a useful data structure in Ruby and are commonly used to store and access data in web applications, such as user information or product details.
