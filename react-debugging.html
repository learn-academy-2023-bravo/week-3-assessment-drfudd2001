<!-- ASSESSMENT 3: React Debugging Challenge -->

<!-- This file contains a React component in an HTML file. This React code is broken. Fix the THREE bugs in the code so the user can draw cards and reset the deck. Note: The component is correctly described in this file structure. There is no need to change the architecture of any code. -->

<!-- To see this app render, open the file in your browser by going to file >> open file >> and finding the appropriate file location. -->
